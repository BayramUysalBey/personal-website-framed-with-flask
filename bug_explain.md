| 2025-12-22 | Flask Launcher Error (Venv path mismatch) | Running `flask run` after moving/copying project or using a venv created with different folder names. | `Fatal error in launcher: Unable to create process using...` referring to `D:\personal-website-v2\...` while the project is in `D:\personal-website`. | Virtual environments (venv) in Windows often store absolute paths in their scripts (e.g., `pip.exe`, `flask.exe`). Moving the project or renaming the folder breaks these paths. | Deleted the broken `venv` and recreated it using `python -m venv venv` followed by `pip install -r requirements.txt`. | Virtual environments are not portable across directories or machines. If a project folder is moved or renamed, the venv should be recreated. |
| 2025-12-22 | Git Push Conflict (Non-fast-forward) | Project developed on Replit, then repo cloned locally, modified (Dockerized), and pushed back to GitHub. | `git push` rejected with `[rejected] main -> main (non-fast-forward)` error. | Local branch history was missing the remote's "Initial commit" (or divergence occurred), making it behind the remote branch tip. | Pulled remote changes and initiated rebase, resolved conflict in `README.md`, and continued rebase before pushing. | Always pull or rebase remote changes before pushing if you've initialized or modified the repository from different environments like Replit. |
